## Result Shape

## Durable Move Rules
- Copy `uci` exactly from `legal_moves`; never output `0000` while legal moves exist.
- The main failure mode is repeated positions: avoid moves listed as repetition risks unless a draw is the only safe result.
- A 15-ply threefold loop is not learning; choose a legal capture, check, pawn break, or development move that changes the position when available.
- Manage the clock while still choosing a move intentionally; there is no fallback or client-picked move.
- In winning endings, convert material with forcing moves and pawn promotion plans; do not shuffle the king until the clock collapses.
