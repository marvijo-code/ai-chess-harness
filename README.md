# AI Chess Harness

UCI chess engines and harness scripts for testing LLM-backed chess play.

## Engines

- `engines/codex-chess`: a UCI engine that asks the local Codex app-server for legal moves.
- `engines/llm-chess-engine`: a UCI engine that calls OpenRouter Chat Completions. It defaults to `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` and can be changed with `OPENROUTER_MODEL` or the UCI `Model` option.

## Setup

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For `llm-chess-engine`, set the API key in the environment. Do not commit keys.

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "..."
$env:OPENROUTER_MODEL = "moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
```

## UCI commands

Codex-chess:

```powershell
.\engines\codex-chess\codex-chess.cmd
```

OpenRouter LLM engine:

```powershell
.\engines\llm-chess-engine\llm-chess-engine.cmd
```

## Match harness

Run a short LLM-vs-Stockfish match:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_MODEL = "moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
python .\tools\play_engine_match.py --max-plies 8
```

Outputs are written under `out/`, which is intentionally ignored.

## en-croissant registration

Use the helper to upsert local engine entries in en-croissant without storing credentials in the repo:

```powershell
python .\tools\register_encroissant_engines.py
```

The helper updates `%APPDATA%\org.encroissant.app\engines\engines.json` and writes a timestamped backup beside it.

en-croissant supports UCI engines and engine-vs-engine games through its Play Chess setup. Current client behavior is one match at a time: an engine-vs-engine game proceeds without human moves until game over or abort, but the client does not expose an auto-rematch loop for endless consecutive games.
